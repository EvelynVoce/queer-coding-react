# QueerCoding

QueerCoding is a React website designed to advertise online classes tailored towards members of the LGBTQ+ community to encourage them to pursue a career in tech by tutoring them and making them capable of creating their own projects in areas such as Python development, web development and machine learning.

This site was also designed as a strong entry point into learning React and C#. Utilising API's and the MVC architecture to create a robust site capable of showcasing demonstratable examples of my experience.
